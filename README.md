##RUBRIC QUESTIONS

**Effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation:

P - proportional controller. It causes the car to steer in a direction proportionally opposite to the cross track error to minimize the cross track error. When this was excluded, the car didn't steer at all and would run off the side of the road.

D - derivative of the CTE. when the error is already being reduced, the car countersteers, avoiding the overshoot and oscillations that prevent the car from staying on the centerline. when this was removed. the car weaved back and forth across the road

I - integral of CTE over time. This is used to correct for steering bias, like wheel alignment issues. the coefficient for this was very small in the simulator because there wasn't much bias, but without any correction with larger biases the object would have a sustained cross track error that wasn't minimized, putting it consistently off center.

**Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen:

I first started to implement twiddle, but without choosing the right starting parameters, the car would veer off the road and get stuck and so there was little improvement between these each of the new error calculations and it was taking a long time. The simulator was run from 100-300 steps to calculate the total error for twiddle and the simulator was reset between twiddle iterations because when the car was off the track the CTE wasn't useful. To speed this up, I also observed the cars behavior and so tuned manually and with twiddle. 

With a small proportially coefficient, the car was turning to the right too strongly, and eventually a small negative coefficient worked best. Also the car was oscillating a lot until a larger i coefficient was used. There didn't seem to be a way the car was always pulling towards so the bias coefficient was close to zero.

The bias seemed small, a small coefficient was needed for the proportional controller and a larger coefficient was needed for the integral term to reduce oscillations.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
